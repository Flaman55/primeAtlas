"""
renderer.py -- feasibility-proven GPU renderer for the Structural Sieve
"drum" (rings + hit teeth, see primeatlas/ring_geometry.py). Standalone
runnable module (see this package's own __init__.py docstring for why it
stays a separate process rather than being imported into the main Tkinter
app): launched as a subprocess by primeatlas/rings_tab.py from Faza 3
onward (see PLAN.md at the repo root for the phased rollout this file is
part of).

Why this exists (Artur, 2026-09-04): Structural Sieve is a browser/Canvas 2D
visualization (see js/render/DrumRenderer.js in the RelationalMathematics
repo) whose practical ring-count ceiling is bounded by what one JS thread can
redraw at interactive frame rates, plus what a browser tab can hold in memory
-- see StructuralSieveApp.js's own "hardware-calibrated auto-track-range"
feature, added specifically because that ceiling is real. PrimeAtlas already
has (a) a magazyn of pre-generated primes far beyond what any in-browser
sieve would attempt, and (b) real GPU hardware, already exercised for actual
sieve marking (see this project's cudasieve/marking_*_poc history).

**Feasibility already confirmed on real hardware** (see PLAN.md's own
"Feasibility already confirmed" section for the full story): 20,000,000
rings loaded in 0.27s, N-change rebuild ~1.3s, pan/zoom held 50+ fps even
with a fast scroll wheel at the full 20M-ring view. This module IS that
proven prototype, landed into the package rather than rewritten -- the only
changes from the standalone prototype version are import paths (now
`primeatlas.ring_geometry` instead of a bare `ring_geometry`) and
`load_magazyn`'s repo-root autodetection (now derived from this file's own
location instead of a `--primeatlas-root` CLI flag, since the file lives
inside the repo it needs to reach into).

Deliberately decoupled from two things this module is NOT responsible for:

  1. Prime GENERATION throughput -- already solved/benchmarked elsewhere in
     this project (04_C_skaner, primesieve integration, etc.). `--source`
     picks where the ring array comes from:
       - synthetic: directly specify a ring COUNT with an arbitrary strictly
         increasing int64 array (no real primality needed at all) -- the
         purest form of the rendering stress test, decoupled entirely from
         how expensive real primes would be to produce at that count.
       - sieve: a real (small-to-moderate scale) sieve of Eratosthenes up to
         --upto, for a real-looking demo.
       - magazyn: reads real floors from an existing PrimeAtlas portal folder
         via primeatlas/storage.py + prime_sieve_v1.read_prime_window, up to
         --upto. HARDENED (Faza 2, see PLAN.md and load_magazyn's own
         docstring): real floor enumeration via storage.list_pietra(), reads
         batched (not one unbounded pass), optional progress_callback -- the
         real per-load wall-clock ceiling at extreme N is still unmeasured
         against a real magazyn (no such data or GPU in the sandbox that
         wrote this), see load_magazyn's own docstring for what to expect.

  2. Whether the resulting picture is mathematically interesting at huge N --
     a separate, later question once the rendering-feasibility question this
     module answers is settled.

Architecture (the part that was actually tested):

  - `primes` (ascending int64 numpy array) is loaded/generated ONCE at
    startup.
  - ring_geometry.ring_positions() recomputes x/y/phase/is_hit ONLY when N
    changes (Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown -- see #advance_n), never every frame:
    test_ring_geometry.py's own benchmark (run in the sandbox that built the
    original prototype, no GPU needed for that half) measured roughly 20M
    rings/second on plain CPU numpy for this recompute -- fine for "user
    pressed a key", far too slow to redo unconditionally at 60fps at tens of
    millions of rings.
  - Panning and zooming the CAMERA never touch that array: they only change a
    2D affine transform (offset + scale) applied inside the vertex shader via
    a uniform, so camera movement stays GPU-cheap regardless of ring count.
    This split -- CPU recomputes geometry on N-change, GPU alone handles
    camera every frame -- is the actual hypothesis that got confirmed on
    real hardware.
  - One `GL_POINTS` draw call per frame (point size set in the vertex shader,
    a soft circular alpha mask in the fragment shader) -- avoids the
    triangle-fan vertex multiplication a "real" circle mesh per ring would
    cost.
  - FPS and ring count are both written to the window title every frame.

Usage -- run as a PLAIN SCRIPT PATH, not `python -m primeatlas.ring_viz.renderer`:
    pip install moderngl glfw numpy
    python primeatlas/ring_viz/renderer.py --source synthetic --count 20000000
    python primeatlas/ring_viz/renderer.py --source sieve --upto 5000000
    python primeatlas/ring_viz/renderer.py --source magazyn \
        --portal-folder "D:\\...\\PORTAL" --upto 50000000000

    Why plain-script-path and not `-m`: `python -m primeatlas.ring_viz.renderer`
    makes Python import the `primeatlas` package FIRST (running
    `primeatlas/__init__.py`, which transitively imports `.manifest`, which
    does a bare `import window_sharding`) before this file's own body -- and
    therefore before the sys.path fix a few lines below ever runs. Run as a
    plain script path instead and that fix executes top-to-bottom before the
    `from primeatlas.ring_geometry import ...` line below is reached, exactly
    like prime_atlas_v1.py's own top-level `sys.path.insert(0, ".../prime_sieve")`
    (see that file) already has to do for the very same reason. If Faza 3's
    subprocess launcher (rings_tab.py) wants `-m` invocation instead, it must
    set `PYTHONPATH` to include the repo root's `prime_sieve` directory itself
    before spawning the subprocess.

Controls:
    drag              pan
    scroll            zoom to cursor
    Up / Down         change N by +/- --n-step (recomputes ring buffer)
    PageUp / PageDown change N by +/- 100 * --n-step (coarse jump)
    Esc               quit

    prime_sieve_v1.read_prime_window for the actual decode.

    HARDENED (Faza 2, see PLAN.md) vs the Faza-0 landing of the original
    feasibility prototype's loader, in three ways:

    1. Enumerates REAL floors on disk via storage.list_pietra() instead of
       blindly incrementing floor with only a fixed sanity cap (`floor > 30`)
       as a guard. A gap in the portal (e.g. floor 5 populated, floor 6 not
       yet) no longer costs an empty list_source_filenames() call for every
       skipped floor, and a portal whose highest real floor is well below
       `upto`'s own floor stops there immediately instead of still counting
       up toward the old hardcoded 30 regardless.
    2. Reads window files in BOUNDED BATCHES (`batch_files` at a time,
       default 64) rather than accumulating one unbounded Python list across
       an entire floor (or several floors) before ever concatenating -- see
       this project's own `c_skaner_odczyt_porcjami` history (04_C_skaner
       once failed the whole sieve, without warning, from a single ~1GB
       fread instead of reading in ~160MB portions) for the class of failure
       an unbounded single pass caused elsewhere in this codebase. Each
       batch is concatenated and appended to the running result list right
       away, so peak EXTRA memory during the load is bounded by one batch's
       worth of arrays, not the whole load -- the final full-array
       concatenate at the end is unavoidable (the renderer needs one
       contiguous sorted array to hand to ring_geometry), but the batching
       here at least keeps the INTERMEDIATE working set bounded.
    3. Accepts an optional `progress_callback(base_exponent, files_read_in_floor,
       primes_loaded_so_far)`, invoked after every batch, so a caller
       (primeatlas/rings_tab.py, Faza 3) can drive a real progress bar
       instead of a frozen GUI during what can be a multi-second load at
       real magazyn scale. Deliberately NOT trying to make the load itself
       faster (see this module's own docstring, data-source point 1, for why
       generation/read throughput is explicitly out of scope for this
       feature to optimize) -- only making the existing cost observable and
       boundable instead of an opaque hang.

    REAL CEILING (documented per PLAN.md's Faza 2 ask): NOT benchmarked here
    -- this sandbox has no real magazyn data or GPU to measure against. The
    rendering ceiling already confirmed on Artur's real hardware is
    20,000,000 rings at 50+ fps (see PLAN.md's "Feasibility already
    confirmed" section); this loader's own cost is dominated by per-file
    open() latency on the FUSE-mounted storage drive (~5ms/file -- the same
    figure storage.update_pietro_totals_cache()'s own docstring measured on
    this exact drive), not the PGS decode work itself. That means the real
    bottleneck to watch for at very high N is FILE COUNT, not prime count: a
    floor with many thousands of small window files costs far more
    wall-clock load time than one with a few large ones holding the same
    total prime count. Artur should measure the real number on his own
    hardware once Faza 3's tab exists to launch this against a real
    magazyn -- this docstring intentionally does not claim a number this
    sandbox cannot verify.

    `prime_sieve` (this repo's sibling top-level directory to `primeatlas/`)
    is added to sys.path here because primeatlas.storage itself does a bare
    `import prime_sieve_v1` / `import window_sharding` (see storage.py's own
